== Even More Shaded Spotify Docker Client

The [Spotify Docker Client for Java](https://github.com/spotify/docker-client) is great.
They even provide a shaded artifact (though they don't provide it at a different `artifactId` so you still get all those transitive dependencies)

The problem is that for some consumers not enough shading has been applied.

This is the same client with *even more* shading... not everything is shaded, but quite a lot is.
Hopefully this will be enough shading for you (it's enough for me)
